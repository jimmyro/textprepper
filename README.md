Generates Latin-to-English and English-to-Latin vocabulary lists with alphabetization and easy-to-read formatting. (from October 2013)

Enter vocabulary words separated by single spaces without punctuation. Choose a name and directory for the output file, optionally choose to alphabetize results, and hit "Generate." The program uses Whitaker's Words (http://archives.nd.edu/words.html) to look up vocabulary.

Unfinished features (i.e. to-do list):
Option to notify the user when a search returns no results and ask for corrections instead of skipping these entries automatically. (The auto/ask buttons in the GUI are in place for this feature.)
Option to choose a text or section of text from The Latin Library (http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/), a simple and comprehensive online repository for major Latin authors and texts.
Using grammatical information from Whitaker's Words entires, attempt syntax highlighting by case or by part of speech. Could piggyback off of the previous feature and return an entire section of highlighted and vocabulary-annotated text.
